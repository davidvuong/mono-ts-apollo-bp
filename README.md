# mono-ts-apollo-bp

**Welcome to mono-ts-apollo-bp!**

This repository is a sample boilerplate project composed of a FE (via CRA) and Apollo GraphQL BE, managed via Lerna and TypeScript throughout. It sits within a Docker container and locally orchtrated using docker-compose. A 3rd package stores shared utility functions and type definitions between the FE and BE. This project uses PostgreSQL as the persistence layer and Auth0 as the 3rd party for authentication.

Digging into the technicals a bit further: prettier and ESLint are used for linting and analysis, jest for unit tests/coverage, and TailwindCSS for styles/themeing.
